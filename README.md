# Introduction-to-Data-Science-in-Python

Assignments for Introduction to Data Science in Python course on Coursera by University of Michigan

When I was doing these assignments, I searched some codes in Internet for help. But I found there are some mistakes in their codes.
So I decided to upload my notebook for those people who may need some help.

Of course, I can not complete these assignments without those codes.

**Thank you all for providing hints to help me.**

**And I hope my code could help other people.**
